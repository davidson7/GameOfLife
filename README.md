As of 3/5/19 this is incomplete. Some parts are implemented or half finished, but making the classes work together without redefining anything is giving me a headache. The only good news is it compiles without errors.
I want to believe my trouble is because of my lack of practice in c++ but I also suspect I'm not thinking in the correct "computer science" way. Either way, more practice is needed.
